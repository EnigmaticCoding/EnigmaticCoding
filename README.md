## Hello there!
I'm EnigmaticCoding, or EC, and you've found yourself on my github. Welcome! 

## About me
I like to tell people I was born with a pencil in my hand, the drive to create preinstalled in my brain. I'm someone who looks out into the world for inspiration and asks myself "how are they doing that? How can ùòê do that?" With the world turning digital my next step is to get under the hood of the software that drives our lives, learning the tools of the trade so I can bring my creative drive to building the infrastructure of our modern age.

## Current projects:

### Learning C#
Working through lessons to learn C#

### Lunch bot
Currently working on a discord bot written in Java. Designed to suggest local lunch spots based on desired tastes. 

#### Week 5
* Working on a command to display the most current list of restaurants.

## Future projects:

### Vibe-check bot 
Simple discord bot written in Javascript. Designed to check the post history in a given thread and report on the 'vibes'.
* Planning stages.

### Personal website
Create a website to further enforce the concepts I've learned over the course of Tech Elevator. Would like to attempt it in C#, to futher develop skills in a new language.
* planning stages
